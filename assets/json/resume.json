I am passionate about designing and implementing a high-quality, performance-oriented solution architecture for mission-critical systems. My experience spans the entire software development life cycle (SDLC), including ten years in design and development, five years in automated testing, and two years in delivery toolchain enablement. In particular, I have over ten years of hands-on coding experience with C, C++, Java, and Python and four years of concentration on enterprise-scale C++ and C# projects. I have a solid foundation in underlying operating systems, algorithms, and complexity analysis. Besides technical skills, I have acquired additional skills in people management, process improvement, change management, effective communication, and public speaking. Practical knowledge in software engineering of financial data platforms and a strong background in engineering management are two vital components for success in the Lead Software Engineer (C++) position.","location":{"address":"18 Watchara Rd.
